# PREFACE
I'll be honest with everyone, in 2016 i started to developing and search about code. because of our career is very agitated i never ever had much time and never spended much time asking about the skills that  i had learned. this make me feel like a impostor, everytime i had spend time searching and developing new things or things that were in fashion this feelings growth. In fact, this made me a more professional developer, but this never erased from my mind the questions. the really questions about developing. so now i embraced the idea to make my knowledge more consistent and really study everything again from a to z.


It's not a base to ever developer or something like that, is one thing for me and i keep this weekly until the concepts that i want to read and search are over. the things that i will read and write about, will be separated on folders and. For concepts, i will write PDFs or something like that; and for something that needs more than concepts i will make some codes and publish in the same folder.


The line that i follow is describe by this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) and i keep it with one phrase:

*Honesty in small things is not a small thing.*
